## Releasing a new npm version
- Ensure you have checked out the `deps/breakpad` submodule. If you don't check
  this out, then the source code of breakpad will not be included in the npm
  package, and it will not be possible to build from source.
- Change the version in `package.json`, make a new git tag, and push it to GitHub.
- Wait until the GitHub Actions on the main branch pass.
- The artifacts of the latest GitHub Action run should be downloaded and placed under the `bin` folder
  (replacing the old folder if it exists).

	The bin folder should look like the following.
	```
	bin
	 |_linux-x64
		|_dump_syms
		|_minidump_dump
		|_minidump_stackwalk
	 |_darwin-x64
		|_dump_syms
		|_minidump_dump
		|_minidump_stackwalk
	```

- Then:
	```
	npm publish
	```
